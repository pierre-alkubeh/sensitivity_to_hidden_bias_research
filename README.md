# About
This repository discusses methods for dealing with hidden confounding variables on a casual relationship. It contains two algorithm described in the research paper file "Genetic Matching Algorithms for Sensitivity to Hidden Bias Reduction". The first algorithm, "Sensitivity Analysis Function.R", describes a statistical model for calculating a robust-to-hidden-confounders treatment effect by using genetic matching that optimizes based on Paul R. Rosenbaum (2005)'s paper on sensitivity analysis. The second algorithm, "Brute Confounder Search.R", is method for discovering what the hidden confounders are in a causal relationship. "Replication.R" is the code used in the research paper using the "dw_data_1_" dataset file.
